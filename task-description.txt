UDL Assessment Chatbot - Project Description for LLM Development
Overview: We are developing an AI chatbot trained on the Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
framework to support K-12 teachers in creating more inclusive assessment practices, in public schools in
the USA. The tool is designed to augment rather than replace teacher expertise by building their
capacity for inclusive design.
Core Functionality:
Task 1: Assessment Evaluation
• Analyze existing teacher-provided assessments against UDL principles
• Identify specific barriers to accessibility and inclusion
• Provide detailed feedback on areas for improvement with clear explanations of UDL rationale
• Flag potential issues related to cognitive load, accessibility, and equity
Task 2: Assessment Design Support
• Generate multiple assessment options aligned with UDL Principle 3: Multiple Means of Action
and Expression
• Provide diverse formats for students to demonstrate knowledge (written, oral, visual,
multimedia, collaborative, etc.)
• Ensure options maintain equivalent rigor and learning objectives across formats
• Include brief explanations of why each option supports inclusive learning
Critical Design Requirements:
• Transparency: Explain UDL reasoning behind each suggestion to build teacher understanding
• Teacher agency: Present options rather than prescriptive solutions; enable easy customization
• Cultural responsiveness prompts: Include questions that encourage teachers to consider cultural
context and student-specific factors
• Avoid deficit framing: Focus on removing barriers rather than "accommodating differences"
• Professional development focus: Help teachers learn UDL principles, not create dependency
Training Data Needs:
• UDL Guidelines and framework documentation
• Evidence-based assessment design literature
• Diverse examples of UDL-aligned assessments across subjects and grade levels
• Examples that reflect multiple cultural pedagogical approaches
Output Format:
• Evaluation should include: strengths, barriers identified, specific improvement suggestions, UDL
principles applied
• Assessment options should include: format description, implementation guidance, UDL
rationale, considerations for teacher adaptation
